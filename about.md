My name is Dave Banerjee, and I am an AI policy fellow at the [Institute for AI Policy and Strategy](https://www.iaps.ai/), where I research [AI security](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2849-1.html), [compute governance](https://bluedot.org/blog/introduction-to-compute-governance), and [international verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16074). Right now, I'm writing papers on AI integrity, the problem of ensuring that frontier AI systems are not tampered with (e.g. preventing nation state actors from backdooring American models).

Previously, I did the following stuff:

- I was a summer fellow at the [Centre for the Governance of AI](https://www.governance.ai/), where I threat modeled risks from secretly loyal AIs and investigated whether the US or China could robustly hide data centers (AKA Dark Compute). 
- I was a participant in [ARENA 5.0](https://www.arena.education/), a 5-week ML alignment bootcamp. In my ARENA [capstone project](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFohZdFPGj2iphnvB/do-self-perceived-superintelligent-llms-exhibit-misalignment), I investigated whether self-perceived superintelligent LLMs (LLMs convinced that they are superintelligent via prompting) exhibit misalignment. 
- I was a research fellow in the [SPAR program](https://sparai.org/), where I forecasted how much it costs to hack an Nvidia H100 (i.e. how much money, time, equipment, and expertise is required to leak various cryptographic keys off the chip). 
- I was a security engineer at a boutique hedge fund, where I built their security infrastructure from the ground up and led all security operations. 
- I graduated from Columbia University in December 2024, where I studied computer science with a focus on cryptography, reverse engineering, and ML.

My academic interests lie in AI security & governance, hardware & software security, (meta)ethics, physics, and cognitive science. I enjoy thinking about what a post-AGI world will look like and how we can make it as good as possible.
