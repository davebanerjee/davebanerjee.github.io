My name is Dave Banerjee, and I am a summer fellow at the [Centre for the Governance of AI](https://www.governance.ai/), where I research [compute governance](). Previously, I was a participant in [ARENA 5.0](https://www.arena.education/), a 5-week ML alignment bootcamp. In my ARENA capstone project, I investigated whether self-perceived superintelligent LLMs (LLMs convinced that they are superintelligent via prompting) exhibit misalignment. And before that, I was a research fellow in the [SPAR program](https://sparai.org/), where I researched how much it costs to hack an Nvidia H100. And before that, I was a security engineer at a boutique hedge fund, where I built their security infrastructure from the ground up and led all security operations. I recently graduated from Columbia University in December 2024, where I studied computer science (among many other things).

My academic interests lie in AI safety & governance, hardware & software security, (meta)ethics, physics, and cognitive science. My primary goal is improve the welfare of sentient beings, and I think one of the best ways for securing a flourishing future is to ensure that the transition to world with transformative AI goes well.

On my blog, I share ideas I find cool and interesting. My primary goal with this blog is to formulate my opinions more carefully, critically evaluate my beliefs, and enhance my writing and research skills. Although I primarily write for myself, I hope you enjoy exploring my thoughts and learning more about the world alongside me.

In the projects section, I document my research projects, programming projects, and other longer-form intellectual projects.

In my free time, you can find me rock climbing, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136154707-dave-banerjee), thrifting, dancing, or folding laundry.
