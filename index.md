Welcome! I am an AI policy fellow at the [Institute for AI Policy and Strategy](https://www.iaps.ai/), where I research [AI security](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2849-1.html), [compute governance](https://bluedot.org/blog/introduction-to-compute-governance), and [international verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16074). Previously, I was a summer fellow at [Centre for the Governance of AI](https://www.governance.ai/), participant in [ARENA 5.0](https://www.arena.education/), hardware security research assistant through the [SPAR program](https://sparai.org/), and security engineer at a hedge fund. I recently graduated from Columbia University in December 2024, where I studied computer science with a focus on cryptography, reverse engineering, and ML. 

My academic interests lie in AI security & governance, hardware & software security, (meta)ethics, physics, and cognitive science. I enjoy thinking about what a post-AGI world will look like and how we can make it as good as possible.
