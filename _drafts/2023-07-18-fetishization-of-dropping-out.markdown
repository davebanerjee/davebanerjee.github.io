During my freshman year, whenever someone would ask me what I wanted out of college, I would respond, "a reason to drop out."

# Looking for a Reason to Drop Out

I think my desire to drop out was genuine but not rooted in the best reasons. I had been frustrated with school for a while because I felt like I wasn't learning anything useful in any of my classes. My math classes were boring and too easy, my literature course was painful since no one else in the class wanted to be there, my physics class was beginning to feel uninteresting because I just wanted to work on an actual pressing problem. The only class that felt worth it was my writing class. But how could I convince myself that $80,000 of tuition and 30-50 hrs/wk of my time was worth it for the sake of improving my writing abilities. College seemed like a complete waste of time and money.

After internalizing the fact that I was probably wasting my time, I started telling people I was thinking of dropping out. And I couldn't believe how much respect I was gaining. Saying I wanted to drop out was such an easy way to win respect from my peers. As soon as someone heard that I was thinking of dropping out, they would liken me to someone like Zuckerberg or Gates, and I loved being put on that pedestal. This was when I began saying I was looking for a reason to drop out. I thought it was poetic, and it was partially true. I did want to find a project that I loved so much that I didn't need the rigid structure of college to encourage me to pursue it. However, my relationship with college soon became unhealthy.

The more I thought about the opportunity cost of school, the more I loathed my classes. I just wanted to study topics that were relevant to improving the world. I wanted to work on projects that actually made the world a better place. I was tired of hanging out with my physics and math friends who were enamored by the *beauty of equations*. I would scream inside, "WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF PHYSICS WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE DYING OF MALARIA?! WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR ELEGEANT MATHEMATICS WHEN THERE ARE BILLIONS OF CHICKENS BRUTALLY KILLED IN FACTORY FARMS?!"

I would sometimes get really sad thinking about how much time I was wasting. I would think about how many animals were dying because I was deciding to stay in college. On one occasion, I started crying in my room thinking about how much money I was spending on college and how that money could have been used to save thousands of chickens from needless suffering. I thought about how my time studying for worthless classes could have been instead used on working at an effective animal charity. I was trapped. Helpless. 

# No Longer Looking for a Reason to Drop Out

I won't drop out, but I think I might take a gap year. I no longer loath classes. Some of the reasons I think my attitude has changed include:

1. I don't feel as strongly about maximizing utility anymore. I don't feel a pressure to do whatever it takes to increase utility. I no longer feel like I *have* to drop out.
2. I feel extremely<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/cluelessness" target="_blank">clueless</a>, which makes me feel like I don't actually know what the best subjects to study are and that it's probably okay to approach college normally.
3. I left the Effective Altruism community, which has generally made me less stressed about overoptimizing my life and studies.
4. I've generally become more tolerant. I don't get outraged when people eat meat. I don't get upset with my friends who deeply who deeply care about the aesthetics of mathematics and physics.

# What Do I Want Out of College?

I want to learn. I want to learn what I want to learn. And I think college will help me learn what I want to learn.
