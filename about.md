Welcome! I am a third-year at Columbia University studying computer science. I care about promoting human and non-human animal welfare. My academic interests lie in ethics, artificial intelligence, nanomaterials, and rationality. By studying these fields, I hope to better equip myself to tackle issues like factory farming, global governance, and existential risks. On my blog, I share ideas I think are cool and important.

On my blog, I write about philosophy, technology, personal life, rationality, and more! I enjoy rock climbing, attending EDM concerts, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136154707-dave-banerjee), thrifting, dancing, and folding laundry.
